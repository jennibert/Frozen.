    <h3> Biography</h3> 
        <p>Anna was the second princess of Adelaide. The younger sister of Elsa, and forgot her memories as a child due to an accident involving her sister's powers that led her to have a white strip in her hair. Growing up she was alone and struggled to understand why Elsa would isolate herself. She is a very naive person who wanted to marry a man she just met, convinced it was destiny, and angered her sister with her claims. In the end, she was able to reconnect with her sister and realized she was naive and lived happily ever after with her sister and the people she met along the journey to get her sister back.
